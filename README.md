# ESP32 Vision Offloading
This project targets efficient image offloading from an ESP32 camera module to the edge server through Wi-Fi.

## TODOs
- [ ] Use VSCode and ESP-IDF to create a basic ESP32 project.
- [ ] Figure out the connection between ESP32 and the programmer.
- [ ] Build, flash, and run a "hello world" project.
- [ ] Create the "vision-offloading" project which reads images from the camera and prints out the image information (size).
- [ ] Test the "vision-offloading" for our custom-built ESP32 module.
- [ ] Develop network application between ESP32 and edge server.
- [ ] Improve the efficiency of the image streaming.
